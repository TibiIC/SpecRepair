# The Genbuf Experiment

A _normalised_ specification refers to one where all formulae are converted to Disjunctions of Conjunctions.
For some reason, there may be some problems when it comes to comparing this form to a non-normalised form.

The normalisation is necessary for the process of strengthening the specification.

I must find what was the original genbuf specification, before normalisation.
